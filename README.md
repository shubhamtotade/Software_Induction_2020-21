Task: 
1. Download Unity3D software. 
2. Create a plane and a cube on it. Program basic movements to the cube as per keyboard input.

NOTE: 
Be creative. Add physics properties for more realistic movement.
Also while emailing mention your experience with Unity3D, if you have any. 
It's not at all necessary to have previous experience, this is just to get a general idea.
